**Cantillon Effect**
French economist Richard Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localized effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living at the expense of later recipients.[^79]

**Central bank**
A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages the currency and monetary policy of a state or formal monetary union, and oversees their commercial banking system. [^80]

**Currency**
A currency is a system of money in common use defined by governments. Many jurisdictions define their national currency as legal tender, it is money declared by law to be valid for the payment of debts and can't be refused as payment.

**Fiat money** 
A currency (a medium of exchange) established as money, often by government regulation. Fiat money does not have intrinsic value and does not have use value (inherent utility, such as a cow or beaver pelt might have). It has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value.[^81] 
All nation state currencies are fiat currencies. Since 1971 fiat currencies are not backed by gold. The word ”fiat” is Latin and means “let it be done”.

**Fractional-reserve banking**
Fractional-reserve banking, practiced by commercial banks worldwide, involves banks accepting deposits from customers and making loans to borrowers while holding in reserve an amount equal to only a fraction of the bank's deposit liabilities. Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at a central bank. The country's central bank determines the minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the "reserve requirement" or "reserve ratio". This rate varies from country to country. In March 2020 the FED abolished this minimum reserve requirement due to the pandemic. Canada, the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Hong Kong have no reserve requirements.

**Full node**
A full node is a software program that fully validates transactions and blocks. You can run a full node on your home computer or on a Rasperry Pi. Almost all full nodes help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes. They are a part of the peer-to-peer network.

**Hasher**
A specialized computer device, called ASIC that is only used for Bitcoin mining. 

**International Monetary Fund**
The IMF is an international financial institution, headquartered in Washington, D.C., consisting of 190 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world while periodically depending on the World Bank for its resources. Formed in July 1944, at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international monetary system. It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises. Countries contribute funds to a pool through a quota system from which countries experiencing balance of payments problems can borrow money. [^82]

**Lender of last resort**
A lender of last resort (LOLR) is the institution in a financial system that acts as the provider of liquidity to a financial institution which finds itself unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the inter-bank lending market and other facilities or sources have been exhausted. It is, in effect, a government guarantee of liquidity to financial institutions. [^83]

**M0 Monetary Base**
The monetary base (M0) is the total amount of a currency in physical paper and coin that is either in circulation in the hands of the public or in the form of commercial bank deposits held in the central bank's reserves. [^84]

**M1 Money Stock**
M1 is a narrow measure of the money supply that includes physical currency, demand deposits, traveler’s checks, and other checkable deposits. M1 does not include financial assets, such as savings accounts and bonds.[^85]

**M2 Money Stock**
M2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money as savings deposits, money market securities and mutual funds. These assets are less liquid than M1 and not as suitable as exchange mediums, but they can be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits. M2 is closely watched as an indicator of money supply and future inflation, and as a target of central bank monetary policy.[^86]

**Panopticon**
The panopticon is a type of institutional building and a system of control designed by the English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century. The concept of the design is to allow all prisoners of an institution to be observed by a single security guard, without the inmates being able to tell whether they are being watched.[^87]

**Peer-to-Peer Network**
A system of equally privileged, equipotent participants without a hierarchy on the network. The Bitcoin peer-to-peer network is a decentralized system of computers running the Bitcoin software that is validating and distributing transactions.

**Rehypothecation**
The action of a broker who pledges with a bank or other lender securities already left on deposit with him by a customer as a pledge for their purchase on margin.

**Seed**
12-24 words that in most of the wallets available in the market (HD wallets), produce all the private/public keys which will control your funds on the blockchain. Anyone with the seed has the control over these keys and therefore, over the funds on the associated addresses.

**Surveillance capitalism**
A term coined by Shoshana Zuboff. It describes the systematic commodification of personal data by centralized monopolistic companies with the core purpose of profit-making.

**Wallet**
Software or hardware that holds all your bitcoin addresses and private keys. Use it to send, receive, and store your bitcoin.
