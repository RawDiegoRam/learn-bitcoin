# Invest in Bitcoin?

If you have read this far, you have already invested time and energy in learning about Bitcoin. Why should or shouldn't you begin to use Bitcoin for yourself? Well, I advise you not to do so until you are sure that you want to try it. Only invest as much in Bitcoin as you understand and are comfortable to - only as much as you are willing to lose in a worst-case scenario.

The more you get to know and use Bitcoin, the more trust you will build. I researched the topic for three months before I installed my first bitcoin wallet and exchanged my first 75 euros for bitcoin. I want to help you to make up your own mind so will now discuss the most common arguments for and against Bitcoin.
