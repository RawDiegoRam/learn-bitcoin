# Bitcoin's Price

## Price Discovery
There is no one official price for bitcoin. It is determined in real time separately on exchanges like Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Binance etc. There are sites like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko and BitcoinAverage https://anita.link/average which show you a global average of the prices of several exchanges. Or you can go directly to the website of one of the exchanges and look it up.

The price - which is the exchange rate - is determined by the activities of buyers and sellers of cryptocurrency who are trading it in real time. More demand, higher price. Less supply, higher price. This is why the halving is an important event. Even if the demand stays the same, the smaller supply will move the price up.

Bitcoin is an open market. The market's function is to discover what the real value of bitcoin is. The current price of any commodity in an open market is the average of the prices that people actually agreed and traded on over the past period of time. Nobody is setting the exchange rate, the price of bitcoin is discovered.

## Different Price in a Region
If you look up the exchange rate for bitcoin in different countries you will find differences between nations. For instance, buying bitcoin in Zimbabwe with local currency will be more expensive than with USD. That is not because bitcoin is more expensive in Zimbabwe, but because the demand for the local currency is lower. You cannot move your Zimbabwe Dollar out of the country; even Zimbabweans prefer USD. So, people need to pay a premium to buy bitcoin when they use a lower valued currency.
