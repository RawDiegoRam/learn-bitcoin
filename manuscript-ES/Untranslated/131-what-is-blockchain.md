# What Is a Blockchain?
The Bitcoin blockchain is a public, immutable database where all Bitcoin transactions are stored. Thus, "the blockchain" itself is not the revolutionary technological breakthrough as it is usually described in the media. As you learned in chapter 1.4 "The History of Bitcoin", adding a blockchain was the element that finally solved the problem of double-spending and enabled the decentralized issuance of money on a secured decentralized network. Bitcoin has a lot of other preceding technology in it.

In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto never mentioned the word blockchain. Instead, Nakamoto used the term time chain, because the ledger's main use is to store all transactions in the correct chronological order.

Since the word blockchain has become the commonly used term, I will follow suit in using it here. Since it was created in 2009, the Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked. Since 2009, every single transaction has been stored on the blockchain. Every transfer that has been made in Bitcoin since its inception is decentrally stored on an estimated 10,000 to 100,000 computers worldwide. These computers are run by individuals, universities, exchanges and so on. This decentralization makes it hard to attack Bitcoin because, if you attack one computer and the blockchain, there are still thousands of identical databases acting as a consensus-based backup. Attempting to introduce false transactions to the ledger will result in failure because the rest of the nodes around the world would fail to reach a consensus with the impostor node, rejecting its transaction record.

The data within the Bitcoin blockchain is transparent and public. If you make a transaction you can look it up in a Bitcoin explorer, which is like a search engine that trawls the database of transactions as opposed to web pages. You can see the value on a bitcoin address that is recorded on the blockchain. With your private keys - the blockchain equivalent of your password - you have access to your public address and can move the value on the blockchain to another address.

The Bitcoin blockchain belongs to no one, anyone can download it and store it on their own computer. With this "full node", you can also contribute to the strengthening of the Bitcoin network. Why? By verifying your own copy of the blockchain, you are not trusting anyone else to be honest with you. The more people who do this, the more distributed and robust the Bitcoin network becomes.

**Open and Permissioned Blockchains**

Please note the difference between Bitcoin, which is an open blockchain and for instance "Diem" (Facebook's money project token) or the Chinese government's E-Yuan CBDC, which are closed and centralized blockchains.

An open blockchain is accessible to all people, it is decentralized, transparent, uncensorable and neutral, making it the revolutionary money it is: a global, internet-native system that is open to everyone regardless of age, color, privilege, gender or nation. Bitcoin can even be used by machines. No one can keep you from sending it peer-to-peer around the world.

A permission-based, private blockchain, is closed, non-transparent, hierarchically organized and centrally stored. The company or government running the system can exclude and censor your transactions. They can close your account and keep you from spending your money. You're already familiar with this system because it's how the current traditional banking system works.
