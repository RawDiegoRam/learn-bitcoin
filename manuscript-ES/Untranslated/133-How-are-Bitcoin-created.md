## How Are Bitcoin Created?

We were talking about protocols and mathematical rules that regulate how Bitcoin works. A set of rules define how bitcoin are created and circulated. These rules can only be changed through a majority consensus from all parties involved in the Bitcoin network. Individuals, institutions or governments cannot change the Bitcoin rules unilaterally.

In our current monetary system of fiat currencies, the creation of money is in the hands of central bankers. They are steering and controlling the output of banknotes and coins, as well as the amount of credit that commercial banks may lend out, determining the interest rate and thus influencing the value of each unit of money.

Bitcoin are created in a process called mining in a decentralized manner, out of the hands of people with agenda-driven political power. The term "mining" has been chosen because, similar to the extraction of gold, labor and energy input is required for the creation of bitcoin.
