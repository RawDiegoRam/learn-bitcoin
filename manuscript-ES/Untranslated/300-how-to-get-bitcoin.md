## How Do I Get Bitcoin?

You can acquire bitcoin in three ways:
* you exchange fiat for it
* you earn it
* you mine it

The first option is the one most of us choose. You can use an online exchange or a Bitcoin ATM and sell your fiat money for bitcoin.

Earning it is the better option. You could free up your basement and sell goods for bitcoin, or work as a freelancer and get paid in bitcoin et cetera.

Mining is not an option for most private households anymore. In the early days of Bitcoin, it was possible to mine on your computer. Today, sophisticated hardware - ASICs miners - is required and you need a very cheap source of electricity to remain profitable.

In the next chapters, we will go into the requirements to hold and use Bitcoin.
