### Privacy in the Digital Age

Bitcoin is pseudonymous. This means that your wallet and your Bitcoin addresses are not linked to your identity as neither your name, place of residence nor IP address is stored.

An exception to this is to create a user account on a centralized Bitcoin exchange when you exchange fiat for bitcoin. Here, as with traditional banks, proof of identity and registration can be required. In certain circumstances, tax offices and government agencies can force an exchange to release your identifying data and related Bitcoin addresses.

If you publish your Bitcoin address on the internet or announce it anywhere else, everyone can check how many coins you own in a block explorer. Be careful with this and don't always use the same Bitcoin address. The wallets that I'll present to you later will automatically create many different Bitcoin addresses so you don't have to worry about that.

Bitcoin is not as anonymous as it is often assumed. All cash flows can be analyzed with sufficient effort. Companies such as Chainalysis specialize in these big data evaluations and clients, such as banks, can pay for this service. Work is underway to improve the privacy of Bitcoin. Over the next two years, there will be innovations here that do not interfere with the use of Bitcoin and offer more data protection.

The cryptocurrency Monero, which has been in existence since 2014, offers already built-in privacy protection. Here the addresses are not publicly visible and blockchain analysis is not possible.
