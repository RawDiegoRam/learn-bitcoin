## Strategy

### How to Defy Volatility
There is a very good way to avoid bitcoin volatility when using it as a payment. When you spend bitcoin on something, you replenish your wallet immediately by buying back those bitcoin with fiat money after the transaction. That way, you don't lose any money because the price of bitcoin remains almost the same in such a short span of time.

### Create a Savings Plan
Procure a small sum of bitcoin periodically - every day/week/month. This is also known as dollar cost averaging (DCA) - or fiat cost averaging (FCA). By spacing out your purchases you balance out the volatility of bitcoin's price over a longer period of time.

On websites like [Bitcoin Dollar Cost Average](https://www.bitcoindollarcostaverage.com/) you can calculate the differences in returns for several purchasing strategies.

### Trading
There are countless trading experts online who tell beginners how to "time the market" and predict the movement of bitcoin's price. They try to sell you trading software and seminars. Stop. Don't spend your time and money on trying to do that. You can't time the market. The big players will get you "rekt." On top of that, you will pay a lot of trading fees and keep in mind that you may have to track all trading movements for tax reasons. In some countries your bitcoin gains are tax-free if you do not exchange the coins for 12 months. Each trade can be a new taxable event.

### Altcoins
Altcoins is the abbreviation for alternative coins. These are all crypto assets that were created after Bitcoin. Many beginners follow the advice to "diversify their portfolio" and start to trade their bitcoin with Altcoins. Thousands of Altcoins are listed on [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). You can't research all of them and most are not being developed anymore and are worthless. Bitcoin is the first-mover and the asset with the biggest network effect. My personal opinion is, if you want to diversify, do it with your knowledge. Go deeper into the Bitcoin rabbit hole, learn how to self-custody, learn how to set up a node, learn about new developments like DeFi on Bitcoin or learn how to earn bitcoin.

However, you might be tempted to give it a try. Use the website [If you had bought crypto](https://ifyouhadboughtcrypto.com/) to compare your earnings in recent years if you had invested in Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dash, Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash.

### If I Had Only...I'm Too Late
If you had only bought Bitcoin in 2011, you would be very rich by now. That is true and I would congratulate without envy, because you were one of the few people who believed in Bitcoin and were ready to put your hard earned money into a risky experiment. None of the early adopters knew that Bitcoin would rise like it has done. It was very difficult to secure your keys back then and many bitcoin were lost or stolen. If you had made it through and preserved your coins, you might have sold it all in 2014, maybe 2017? It is pointless to ponder about "what if". We are still in the early days. If you are starting to educate yourself and use Bitcoin now, you're still leagues ahead of the masses. It's never too late to learn about Bitcoin.

### Taxes
I'm not a tax advisor but what I can say is, learn about the regulations and tax requirements in your jurisdiction. The Bitcoin blockchain is transparent and more and more tax authorities will require exchanges to hand them their trading data. Keep proofs of your purchases in case authorities start investigating.
